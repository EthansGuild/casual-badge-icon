## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to get more out of your Casual Mode badge? Wait no longer! Now, you can set your Team Fortress 2 desktop shortcut to any Casual Mode badge with my custom-made high quality renders.

## Features
- HD renders of TF2 Casual Mode badges
- Easy setup and installation
- Customizable icons for your desktop shortcut

## Installation
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest "Simple" release from the [Releases](https://github.com/greagob/casual-badge-icon/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded files to a directory of your choice.
3. Run the executable to set up your TF2 desktop icon.

## Alternative Installation
This is **for those who would not like to repeatedly select their Desktop and Icons folders each time they open the program.** The alternative installation is more complicated because you need to have Python working on your machine and you need to have all of the libraries installed.
1. Download the latest "Alternative" release from the [Releases](https://github.com/greagob/casual-badge-icon/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded files to a directory of your choice.
3. Install Visual Studio Code or some sort of environment that allows use of the Python Interpreter.
4. Make sure you have Python 3.12 or newer, the version I used was 3.12.4
5. Open command prompt and type the following to install win32:

   > pip install pywin32
7. Try running the program. If using Visual Studio Code, make sure you have the "Code Runner" extension.
8. The program should perfectly run now, and it will create a config.json file that stores your Desktop and Icon folder directories so you do not have to repeatedly choose it every time you open the program.
9. [Optional] For easy usage, you can create a batch file that runs the 'Casual Badge Icon.py' python file. I recommend you ask ChatGPT for more details.

## Compatability
- It has only been tested on Windows 10, though it should work fine on Windows 11.
- It will probably not work on any Linux distros. (haven't tested)
- It is built to fully function without internet access.

## Usage
1. Launch the program.
2. Select your Desktop Folder and the Icons Folder included in the download (You only have to do this ***once*** if you go through the Alternative Installation)
3. Enter your desired Tier and Level for the casual badge desktop shortcut.
4. Click on "Submit" to change your TF2 desktop icon.
